# 1337Link-T
<img src="assets/img1.png">
A fork of the awesome <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/73">TV-B-Gone V2</a>, in the format of a cufflink. They'll never see it coming! (until they see this GitHub...)

## How it works
The working principle is very similar to the TV-B-Gone V2, except miniaturized and with only one wide-angle infrared (IR) LED. An ATTiny85 microcontroller sleeps in low-power mode, wakes up when you press the button (wired to its reset line), and sends out all of the TV power codes one by one. Although the single 60Â° (angle of half intensity) LED doesn't give it as much range, the 1337Link is much more discreet (well, it will be after I replace that incredibly bright green LED); it's also powered by a small LiPo battery (that I had lying around), which can be neatly tucked into your shirt cuffs.  

## Design notes
Schematic files available soon.
I used an ATTiny85 instead of the 85V variant, just because it was available during the chip shortage of 2022. 
As I was only driving one SMD LED, I used the single transistor of the TV-B-Gone V1 to control the LED. All the circuitry is packed onto one 18mm dia. PCB and glued onto a cufflink blank with superglue.

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/TV-B-Gone-kit">Adafruit's original repo</a> for providing the well-commented code that this project uses. 

> When we were putting together the TV-B-Gone kit, we started imagining a dystopian future, filled with televisions, where this kit would be super useful and we'd be a hero for having one.  And while maybe that's dramatic, the TV-B-Gone is perfect for playing pranks on your friends during the Super Bowl or getting some peace and quiet during dinner.

> The TV-B-Gone is a kit that, when soldered together, allows you to turn off almost any television within 150 feet or more.  It works on over 230 total power codes - 115 American/Asian and another 115 European codes.  You can select which zone you want during kit assembly.

> This is an unassembled kit which means that soldering is required - but it's very easy and a great introduction to soldering in general.  The kit's powered by 2x AA batteries - that aren't included - and the output comes from 2x narrow beam IR LEDs and 2x wide-beam IR LEDs.  

> The TV-B-Gone covers almost any television from the brands listed below, including the latest flat-screens and plasma TVs.  There's also lots more info on the [TV-B-Gone website](https://learn.adafruit.com/tv-b-gone-kit).

> And now for the brands!
